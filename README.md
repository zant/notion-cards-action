# Notion Cards GH Action

This card updates a property from a page linked in a PR description. Commonly used to update the "Status" property of a card used to keep track of features.

**How does it works?**

A regex match is performed over the PR body. It matches the first URL that has `notion.so` format in it, and then the ID of the Card is extracted from the URL.


**Variables**
| Key | Description |
|-------|-------|
| NOTION_KEY | The token url retrieved from the token cookie in your browser |

**Inputs**
| Key | Description |
|-------|-------|
| page_property | The name of the property to update. This property _must_ be already created in Notion. Default is "Status" |
| on_pr | The value of PAGE_PROPERTY to be updated on PR event. Default is "Code Review" |
